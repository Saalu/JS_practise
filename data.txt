I love coding and would like to develop a career in that regard.
As such I have made coding every single day routine; practising what i have learned 
previously and, reading and learning new things as well.
I want to be recognise renowned internationally for my coding prowess.
Hence exert double the effort of my counterparts so that I can achieve my goal.
